- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ArnouldN
-Live in France and used to use and program the Sinclair QL from november 1984
-I use Linux, now Ubuntu but want to switch Linux Mint Debian Edition 
since Ubuntu people dropped 32 bits systems, IMHO a pity.
-I find Linux extremely difficult to use to do non standard things. 
I simply never could really enter into the arcane difficulties of the system to program it,
so I use it...
- For example I am here because LMDE does not have a given very small module ec_sys
and I don't know how to compile it "off tree". Off tree: something new to me since yesterday,
and again, what should be simple, becomes extremely difficult, compile a module "off tree"....
